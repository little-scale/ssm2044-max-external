- **Analog Saturation Modeling**: Tanh-based nonlinear saturation in input and feedback paths
- **Self-Oscillation Capability**: Authentic resonance behavior with self-oscillation above Q≈3.5
- **lores~ Pattern**: 4 signal inlets accept both signals and floats for sample-accurate modulation
- **SSM2044 Character**: Classic 24dB/octave rolloff with musical analog response
- **Denormal Protection**: Stability safeguards prevent CPU spikes and audio artifacts
- **Universal Binary**: Compatible with Intel and Apple Silicon Macs

## Historical Context

The SSM2044 is a legendary voltage-controlled filter IC designed by Dave Rossum at Solid State Music (later acquired by Yamaha). It became famous for its use in:

- **Korg Polysix** (1981) - 6-voice polyphonic analog synthesizer
- **Korg Mono/Poly** (1981) - 4-voice unison/polyphonic synthesizer  
- **Sequential Circuits Pro-One** (1981) - Monophonic analog synthesizer
- **Various Eurorack modules** - Modern analog filter designs

The SSM2044's smooth, musical character and stable self-oscillation made it a favorite among synthesizer designers and musicians.

## Parameters

### Inlets
1. **Audio Input** (signal)
   - Input signal to be filtered
   - Range: -1.0 to +1.0 (standard audio range)

2. **Cutoff Frequency** (signal/float, 20-20000 Hz)
   - Filter cutoff frequency in Hz
   - Musical response curve with analog-style warping
   - Default: 1000 Hz

3. **Resonance** (signal/float, 0.0-4.0)
   - Filter resonance/Q factor
   - 0.0 = no resonance, 4.0 = maximum resonance
   - Self-oscillation typically begins around 3.5
   - Default: 0.5

4. **Input Gain** (signal/float, 0.0-4.0)
   - Input gain with analog-style saturation
   - 1.0 = unity gain, >1.0 adds harmonic saturation
   - Higher values produce more analog-like distortion
   - Default: 1.0

### Output
- **Filtered Signal**: -1.0 to +1.0 range
- **Frequency Response**: 24dB/octave (4-pole) low-pass rolloff
- **Resonance Peak**: Adjustable resonance with smooth self-oscillation transition

## Technical Implementation

### Zero-Delay Feedback (ZDF) Topology

The filter uses a ZDF implementation for stability and accuracy:

```
Input → [Saturation] → [4-Pole Cascade] → Output
            ↑              ↓
        [Feedback] ← [Saturation] ← [Resonance Gain]
```

**Benefits of ZDF**:
- Stable at all resonance settings
- No delay in feedback path
- Accurate frequency response
- Smooth self-oscillation transition

### 4-Pole Cascade Structure

Each pole contributes 6dB/octave rolloff for a total of 24dB/octave:

```
Stage 1 → Stage 2 → Stage 3 → Stage 4 → Output
   ↓         ↓         ↓         ↓
[Light]  [Medium]  [Heavy]    [Clean]  ← Saturation levels
```

**Inter-Stage Saturation**:
- Emulates component-level nonlinearities
- Adds harmonic content and analog character
- Prevents excessive signal buildup

### Analog Modeling Techniques

**Input Saturation**:
```c
// Tanh-based saturation with asymmetry
double saturated = tanh(input * drive);
saturated += 0.05 * tanh(input * drive * 0.5)²;  // Even harmonics
```

**Frequency Warping**:
```c
// Analog-style frequency response
double warped_freq = tan(π * normalized_freq * 0.5);
```

**Resonance Compensation**:
```c
// Maintain consistent output level with varying resonance
double compensation = 1.0 + resonance * 0.5;
resonance_gain /= compensation;
```

## Development Patterns Demonstrated

This external showcases several advanced Max SDK patterns:

1. **Zero-Delay Feedback**: Stable recursive filter topology implementation
2. **Analog Modeling**: Nonlinear saturation and frequency warping techniques
3. **lores~ Pattern**: Perfect signal/float dual input handling
4. **Sample-Accurate Processing**: Per-sample parameter updates for modulation
5. **Denormal Protection**: CPU optimization and stability safeguards
6. **Universal Binary**: Cross-architecture compatibility

## Implementation Details

### ZDF Mathematics

The zero-delay feedback system solves the implicit equation:
```
y[n] = G(x[n] + k·y[n])
```

Where:
- `G` = 4-pole transfer function
- `k` = resonance feedback gain
- `x[n]` = input sample
- `y[n]` = output sample (solved implicitly)

### Coefficient Calculation

**Cutoff to Integrator Gain**:
```c
double normalized_freq = cutoff / sample_rate;
double warped_freq = tan(π * normalized_freq * 0.5);
double g = warped_freq / (1.0 + warped_freq);
```

**Resonance to Feedback Gain**:
```c
double k = resonance * 3.8;  // Scale factor
k /= (1.0 + resonance * 0.5);  // Compensation
```
